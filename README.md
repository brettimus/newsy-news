A static layout for a hacker-or-designer-news-esque site.

## What's going on here?
There is a lot of stuff in this repo. Ignore most of it.

### HTML and (S)CSS

**Dependencies**
* html5 boilerplate
* `pure.css` base styles
* `pure.css` responsive grid system
* SCSS

To run the watcher on the `style.scss` file, make sure you have `sass` installed, 
and run `sass -w style.scss:style.css`. I have this command aliased as `sw` in my `.bash_profile`.

### JS
We are loading some boilerplate, jQuery, and Modernizr, but they are not yet in use.
